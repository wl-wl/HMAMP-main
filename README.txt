HMAMP: Designing Highly Potent Antimicrobial Peptides Using a Hypervolume-Driven Multi-Objective Deep Generative Model

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have exhibited unprecedented potential as biomaterials in combating multidrug-resistant bacteria,
prompting many excellent generative models proposed. But the multi-objective nature of AMP discovery is often overlooked,
contributing to the high attrition rate of drug candidates. Here, we propose a novel approach termed Hypervolume-driven
Multi-objective Antimicrobial Peptide design (HMAMP), which prioritizes the simultaneous optimization of multiple attributes
of AMPs. By synergizing reinforcement learning and a gradient descent algorithm rooted in the hypervolume maximization
concept, HMAMP effectively biases generative process and mitigates the issue of pattern collapse. Comparative experiments
show that HMAMP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in effectiveness and diversity. A knee-based decision
making is then employed to fast screen generated candidates. These candidates exhibit favorable physicochemical properties,
including moderate charge and amphiphilicity, aligning with the multi-objective optimization aim of enhanced antimicrobial
activity and reduced side effects. Helical analysis and molecular simulation further elucidate structural and functional properties
of the AMPs. Overall, HMAMP is a highly effective approach to traverse large and complex exploration space in search of
potential candidates and design idealism-realism trade-off AMPs.
